Using machine learning to parse an image to text is a common problem closely tied to neural networks.For example, the MNIST dataset is a common introduction to neural networks. \cite*{lecun_2010_MNIST} When it was originally released, the application of models trained on the dataset was to parse the numerical values written on checks. Google's use of reCAPTCHA also demonstrates how optical character recognition worth pursuing. \cite*{Ahn_2008_reCAPTCHA} In our project, we want to apply this technology to the recognition of handwritten mathematical expressions in order to transcribe their content into typesetting languages such as LaTeX.
