\indent Having narrowed down the problem to model accuracy based on preprocessing technique, we will consider the types of neural networks we will use. Given the informal nature of this assignment, we will take a random group of networks that are used in field. First, we will use WAP (Watch, attend, and parse). It was created in from CROHME 2016 with a few papers written about it. Second, we use another DenseNet based convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in a paper by Wang and Shan. At the moment, we are still looking into alternate models to use in our project and will finalize the models used in our project following a more thorough literature review.
